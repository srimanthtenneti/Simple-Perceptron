# Simple-Perceptron
This project aims to build a simple perceptron model for embedded systems. This repository is the initial version of the model. In the future version we aim to create an API for embedded platforms.

## Supported platforms
1) Arduino
2) STM32F4
3) MSP430
5) PSOC4

## Description
As there is no unfied API that can support and help designers with their Neural Network designs our C based API will assist them on their journey. This API will first be developed for a perceptron model for all the platforms and in the future versions feed forward neural networks will be included.

## Working Prototype
1) Arduino
